# A movies database site

Design and development of a full responsive movie search and discovery website. The user can browse through various movie sections like popular, top rated, upcoming or trending movies. Each movie section contains movie posters, which the user can click on to see more details about the movie, like movie overview, release date, vote average or can add his favourite movies to watchlist. Also the user can search a movie through the search bar on top of the page and take the results. The code uses React to build the user interface, to manage the state of the website and dynamically render content based on user input. Also uses React Context Api to manage the state of user's watchlist and share that state throughout the component tree. The useState hook is used to manage state variables, while the useEffect hook is used to handle side effects such as making API requests. The react-router-dom library is used to handle client-side routing and allow the user to navigate between pages without having to reload the entire website. Finally, the axios library is used to make HTTP requests to the TMDb API.
